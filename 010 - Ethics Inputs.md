Advantage goes to organizations that:
	Have data talent
	Have the data
	This is historically for-profit companies and corps
		They can buy data
		They can hire good talent
	Counterbalance
		Open government
		Making more data public (but not personal data?)
		Make data and talent cheaper, more abundant. Level the playing field more.

It's about making finer-grain distinctions
	This is the opposite of government, insurance, or collectivism
		In that, you dealt with the *aggregate*
	It's every group/person for themselves
		Different insurance rates, for example
	There will be winners and losers
		"You get a discount for being a good driver"
		"We are charging you more because stats suggest your religion is riskier"
		"We are charging you more for health insurance because your daughter's FB comments suggest she's more likely to get pregnant in the next 18 months"
	But it's the aggregate that counts
		Companies' profit margins
		Loss ratios
	When people can make money by screwing other people, then greed becomes a huge problem
		Banks / Finance
		Insurance
		Health insurance
		Hospitals
		Retail
		Advertising
	My lesson
		I can't trust companies or executives to behave ethically out of a sense of good behavior
			Thank you, vampire squid and HSBC
		Because big data practitioners are few and far between, I can make a difference there
			Get 'em early
			Get 'em young
		Appeal to the talent. They're the bottleneck
	Regulatory fix
		When dealing with individual, personal data, each person must opt-in to any transfer of their data to a third party.
		
It can also be used for great good
	The data involved is to benefit humanity
		Medicine
		Car safety
		Food quality and processing

Data engineers are desperately needed for:
* Chemical engineering research
* Protein research
* Aerospace engineering
* Genome sciences
* Molecular design


* Ethics = the sum of our actions, for good and worse. Also the sum of what we take from the world.
