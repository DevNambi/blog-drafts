# Personal Security

* Target, Home Depot, JP Morgan, you name it

### Core Lessons

* The incentives for keeping data secure are all missing
* Data's genius is also its Achilles heel: perfect copying
* No way to prove that you are you that a hacker can't exploit
* You will get hacked. The incentives are there.



### Make Yourself a Hard Target

* Don't re-use passwords
* Pick complicated passwords. Use pass phrases. Random generator. Password vault of some kind.
* Two-factor auth
* Fake identity questions
* Change passwords over time
* Credit freeze
* Computer, smartphone security
* Don't use services that get hacked.
    * Companies that pay their IT professionals low amounts.
    * Companies that have been hacked before.
    * Any place that limits the length of your password
* Also goes for significant others, spouses, kids
* Offer this as a service to friends, in trade.

#### When You Get Hacked, Find Out Quickly

* Credit monitoring services
* Alerts


#### When You Get Hacked, Have It Not Be a Huge Deal

* Separation of security
* Password reset emails
* Identify single points of failure
	* Accounts
	* Locations
	* Devices
    * Companies that know enough about you that they could use it as leverage
        * Google
        * Facebook
        * Amazon
        * Anything that has your email or web-browsing habits
        * Banks
        * Medical companies
* (DRAW A GRAPH, TYPICAL AND SAFE)
* 


### Pay for Good Ideas

* One-time, limited-time debit/credit cards
* Two-factor auth
* Strong encryption
* Anything that gives companies incentives to protect your data (higher liability, reputational risk, etc)


### Know Your Limits

* Don't try protecting yourself from huge states (Mossad or not-Mossad). 
    * Add XKCD comic. 
    * Add James Mickens references.


### Not a Goal: Don't Be a Target

* Keep a low profile (ummm)
* Have nothing worth stealing (ummm)
* Don't speak up about things you care about, that could make you a target (GamerGate, gun violence, inequality, racism, you name it)
