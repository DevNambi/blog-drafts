# Personal Security

* Target, Home Depot, JP Morgan, you name it

### Core Lessons

* The incentives for keeping data secure are all missing
* Data's genius is also its Achilles heel: perfect copying
* No way to prove something is you that a hacker can't exploit
* Don't try protecting yourself from huge states (Mossad or not-Mossad). Add XKCD comic. Add James Mickens references
* You will get hacked. The incentives are there.

### Goal 1: Don't Get Hacked

* Keep a low profile (ummm)
* Have nothing worth stealing (ummm)
* Don't use services that get hacked (ummm)
* Don't re-use passwords
* Pick complicated passwords. Random generator. Password vault of some kind.
* Two-factor auth
* Fake identity questions
* Change passwords over time
* Credit freeze
* Computer, smartphone security

#### Goal 2: When You Get Hacked, Find Out Quickly

* Credit monitoring services
* Alerts


#### Goal 3: When You Get Hacked, Have It Not Be a Huge Deal

* Separation of security
* Password reset emails
* Identify single points of failure
	* Accounts
	* Locations
	* Devices
