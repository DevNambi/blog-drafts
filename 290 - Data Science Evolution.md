## Data Science and Data Warehousing

They are a cautious match. 

Data Warehousing - stability. 

Data Science - discovery, new things. 

* Those cause friction.
* Feature engineering is a big problem - a lot of ML algorithms work only when you have the right data. DW limits what you get, and drastically slows down what you can add.
* Tooling is another. DW is largely relational databases and cubes. Cutting edge is viz tools like Tableau, and 'big data' tools like Hadoop/Hive.
* Data Science uses an overlapping tool set, including things like 
* DW includes a lot of process overhead. The reason is the assumption that 'if you build it, they (analysts) will come'. That doesn't happen very often. Also, operational reporting (what has happened) is far, far easier than predictive analysis (what will happen) and optimization (how can I change what will happen to be optimal). They have similar tooling, sometimes, but very dissimilar skills. 
* Operational reporting - no margin of error.
* Prediction - margin of error. Limitations in what can be predicted with the data. 
* I've seen job postings for 'big data engineers' or 'platform engineers' that focuses largely on pipelines. 'Pipelines' are a natural fit for ETL developers and anyone who is comfortable with query optimization; the principles are the same, but the tools are different.
* Not design-heavy. Data modeling happens *after* you know what you need to build. DS helps build data *products*. The data model for Netflix's "Movies you may like" is far less important than the application itself.

Rejecting jobs and work you are qualified for. Thats a trap.
Being humble. Admit you don't know crap. Learn from smarter people.
