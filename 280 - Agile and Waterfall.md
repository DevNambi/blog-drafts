## Agile and Waterfall

### Story sizing
* More important when in a semi-waterfall environment.
	* Good signal that your story process has too much overhead
	* Important for 'agilefall' because overhead happens all the time.


### Agilefall

* The mullet of software development. Agile at its core, waterfall around it.
* Project mgmt nightmare.
