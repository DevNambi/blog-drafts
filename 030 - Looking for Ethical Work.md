## Looking for Ethics in All The Right Places

* Code Like You Give a Damn
* Work Like You Give a Damn


* Finding an ethical job.
* What industries are ethical?
   * Defined by the business model
   * Defined by the source.
   * Define value-add vs. value-removed.
   * Use Maslow's pyramid.
   * Look at markup of creators vs consumers. How much does the middle capture?
   * Leakage: MPAA takes all the money, gives none to artists. Same w/ food processors.
   Helpers end up owning the joint
   Why? Reductionism: genius is hard to measure, and harder to reproduce
   Intermediaries become the *point*
   Proxy metrics instead of real metrics
Industries 
* Include industry size
* Include markup between consumer and original creator.
   • Law
   • Medicine

   • Realtors
   • Any cottage industries
   • Education

### Support real work, and disrupt everything else

* Disrupt telecommunications. They're a tax on the Internet
** Wireless instead of wired, to reduce build-out costs
** Use math instead of signal strength. (LINK TO ARTICLE)
** Fundamental as electricity was. Public utilities are one approach.

Work-Life Balance: List the good and bad things, and why
• How to make good things easier
• How to make bad things lesser
• Tea - a good thing
• Banks - a bad thing


**Engineers and Personal Finance
* Time
* Sacrifice


Bad ethics + privilege = intense dislike. Contempt.
   More control/influence = more dislike

tikkun olam

* Cost vs. benefit
   * Matrix prioritization
   * Are you willing to take a pay cut for a better job? What if it was $1 less? How about $10? How about $100? How about $1000? It's a matter of degree; how important the issue is for you, and what you're willing to give up.
      * Most people aren't brave.
      * Or they don't realize they can still live comfortably doing good work. We keep thinking of broke-ass nonprofits. Those exist too.


You. Smart People. 
Women. If you're reading this, then you're ___% likely to be male (Bayesian math given software engineers and gender bias in the industry).

They are more than half our education population now (CHECKME). Studies (LINK) show they care less about the solution or the specific problem and more about what they're solving (note on gender stereotyping).


   ○ We are more effective by empowering people rather than just being awesome
   ○ People are non-deterministic. We accumulate joy and sorrow, frustration. Latency is important. The trick is identifying it early

Help people find work who are ethical. Help them network. People will be more ethical if they don't fear for their livelihood and their family's.
