3. Looking for Ethics in All The Right Places (What industries are ethical?)
4. Disrupting unethical industries.

### Intro

Technical professionals have great power. But we don't consider our effect on society.

(IMAGE: with great power comes great...you know)


We believe we are working to make our society, our world, a better place. At the very least we believe we aren't making things worse. We try and behave **ethically**.

"Ethics: moral principles that govern a person's or group's behavior"

Data - depends on what you do with it. Show example and counterexample, per industry. 
The ethics of the scientific method.

## Disrupting Unethical Industries

* Disrupting unethical industries.
   * But do it for good reasons. Not just to profit.
   * Sharing economy and libraries.

Learn the business model. Nobody in Silicon Valley can disrupt agribusiness without knowing the economics and business models of the existing players.

Software is eating the world. Help software eat the worst parts of the world and leave something better in its place.

### Your Goals Are Important

One of the. 

* Craigslist.
* AutoTrader.

# Raw Notes


"Trust that fails in hard circumstances is not trust at all"
"Nothing good happens in just 1 lifetime" <- short vs. long-term thinking. impatience. Bankers. Public companies & quarterly results
"Join the winning side. You've already lost"

Is profit fundamentally unethical?

Good day: did I help? Did I hurt?

When you can't choose, pick buckets.

### Measuring Industry Impact

Let's measure each industry, and assign a value to them.

(INSERT IMAGE).

However, no business works in a vacuum; they all interact with one another. Suddenly we have a *network* instead of a list.

If I have N (INSERT) industries that link together, and have different association weights (REFINE), then I want to *transfer* some of the weight around to compensate for it. 

There's a famous way to do this: PageRank. This is the same problem as having different web pages that link to each other with different weights. So let's use that. (ACCOUNT FOR INDUSTRY SIZE? CALCULATE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SEPARATELY?)


* Venn diagram: good intentions, being effective, unintended consequences

### Measuring Neutrality

We can use this to measure something else: the effect of building tools. Let's say we build a frameework or tool, called Gorilla. 


* Online ads and SEO as the cruft of society?
* If you just build tools, look at what industries they're used in. Then use Bayesian math to figure out if your effect is unethical. For example, if you build a better big data engine, what % of big data engines are used for the NSA or online ad serving?
