### List of things I still can't do in November 2014

-- from https://www.facebook.com/frkrueger/posts/10154867033210444


**Legit**

* Get a blood test simply, myself, without going to a lab, and get the results overnight.
* Build a house myself using standard small interchangeable parts like legos.
* Build a website with a resolvable domain on the internet, a great theme, and configurable data inside of 5 minutes.
* Locate where my dog is right now using a barely noticeable GPS chip.
* Share my health and fitness data with my doctor and my trainer in real time and get advice.
* Have my car keep a web record of everywhere it has been, how it is doing, and what needs fixing or updating.
* Find a list of all LA artists online, browse their work, and buy directly from them without going through an art dealer.
* Vote online.
* Get a doctors house call using an app. (Uber for doctors).
* Move $50,000 into a form of Bitcoin where the value is pegged to the USD, not a random number (the price of Bitcoin)
* take a picture of any object and find out where to buy it (Shazam for things)
* have all my accounting being done as a SASS -- with 24/7 qualified accountants / planners / bill payers and a complete online record of my expense and balance sheet at all time available.
* Enter all my favorite classical music playlists, and have it coordinate with my travel schedule to update me who is playing where.
* Be able to take a course online and get graded -- and get a diploma that means something. Education is really ripe for disruption: Coursera is OK, but we need to invent Stanford 2.0
* Be able to sell my advice online. It's worth something and I should have some way to monetize it.
* Be able to see a list of all single people in LA right now and efficiently sort through this data, with two way opt-in, to find an ideal match
* See videos of restaurants before you go to them. Pictures can be decieving. I want a video.
* Be able to get a $100 MRI. It can be done for this price.
* Be able to get into an ER for under $100. It's ridicoulous that a mere 15 min consultation can cost somebody (the system) $1000+.



**First World Problems**

* Invest $10,000 in Uber in the secondary market by buying some shares from an existing shareholder -- with just a few clicks.
* Find out which are the hot new restaurants in Paris from people who actually know.
* Find a teacher of general relativity online. I tried. 
* Travel to space -- click, pay about 20 million, book a trip to the space station.
* Send $10,000 to my caretaker in France and have her get the cash and withdraw it from an ATM that same day.



**Ignores Paying a Living Wage**

*a.k.a, can be done right now but at a high price*

* Click on a recipe, pick number of people, and have all the ingredients delivered to me the next day by Amazon Fresh
* Get a qualified guitar / piano / cello teacher to come to my house without randomly calling people on craigslist or doing general google searches.
* Get somebody to come to my house, pick up my dry cleaning and drop it back off the next day (Amazon "Clean").


**Ignores Context**

*a.k.a. provides the wrong incentives, or can be badly abused*

* Get a discount from the federal government for being healthy. Fat people should pay more taxes because they cost society more. This means some approved weigh in and testing centers
* Get investors for my startup by advertising the stock offering on the web and selling shares directly.
* Get a quick, binding divorce online.
* Keep track of where everybody in my team is physically right now.
* Call the police or the fire department or paramedics using an app.
