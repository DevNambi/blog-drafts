Attention Please: This is not a rant, but it is long. I'm going to keep this as tinfoil-hat free as possible.

People thought we were kind of silly when we went on an anti-Google tirade a little while ago, and I admit I have relapsed into most of those services. With the recent news about PRISM, I'm now scrubbing my life of non-essential services (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Skype, etc.), and moving anything "cloud" overseas to MEGA and the like. Expect to see less and less of us on Facebook, and for what we post here to become very generic and non-controversial.

Albert Einstein said, "Never do anything against conscience, even if the state demands it." The seven companies now known to be complicit in the US government's unending quest to invade more and more of our lives either have no conscience, or disagree with this philosophy. Either way, they now stand counter to my own convictions. There are a number of alternative services out there that are either foreign-based and not beholden to US law, or are small enough that they are not on the radar. Use them. Vote with your choices in software, services, purchases, habits. If you can, use an SMS application that encrypts your texts (TextSecure on Android) and your voice communications (RedPhone on Android) and your IM communications (GibberBot on Android). Use a mail client that supports PGP. Use a firewall in your home. Use open-source, community-developed alternatives like FireFox and Pidgin instead of Chrome and Google Talk. Use OTR plugins to keep your communications secure. Use Tor.

These little, "inconvenient" things can add up, and I promise you that once you adopt them and get used to them, you'll forget what you thought was so inconvenient. That is the blessing and the curse of the human mind: we adjust quickly to change when forced. So the same psychology that the NSA and FBI and DHS have used to cow us into accepting ever-increasing encroachment into our personal lives can in fact be used as a weapon against that encroachment, through the adoption of more secure practices.

The time for laughing it off as a nutter conspiracy theory is over. What happened in Iran can happen here. What happened in East Germany can happen here. What happened in the former USSR can happen here. What happened in Chile can happen here. These were free societies, of different economic policy, that were overtaken by autocracy. The only way to prevent it is to fight it. The only way to fight it is to starve it.

Each of us has a choice, and our choices matter.
