# Ideas for Seattle's Traffic Problems

* Cars, even carpools, aren't dense enough for growth and efficient transport.
* Buses are. Trains are. Gadgets where we can travel 2 abreast on streets would be (bicycles, electric bikes)

* Movement - it's mostly about the commute. And then, it's often about single commuters.

### Define the Problem

* We want to make traffic better. In particular, we want to reduce the traffic jams that clog up during commute times
* Some traffic is largely unchanging. Business deliveries and truck loads are the best example.

* Most traffic is individuals going to and from work


### Consider Raw Options, Limitations

* We can't increase the number of lanes on the road. Even if we did, California proved that doesn't work.
