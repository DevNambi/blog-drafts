## University Salary Analysis


Why is college expensive? The cost of tuition has gone up dramatically over the last several decades. There have been dozens, even hundreds, of articles discussing the value of an college education. There have been an equal number of articles lamenting how states have cut funding to their colleges.

I haven't read anything about **where the money goes**. 

One of the best college systems in the U.S. is the University of California system (LINK). Where does its money go?

The University spends ___% of its total funding on staff. The rest goes to capital projects, debt service, and more. Even those are largely related to the size of its employee base; people need a place to work, support systems, etc.

The UC system does not provide a useful breakdown further than that (LINKME), but it *does* provide the amounts it pays to its employees by title, along with the number of employees in each role. Thank goodness for public data. 

I cleaned up all of those mainframe, HR-ified titles to the type of work they're likely to do. The raw data, including my mappings, is public, at (LINK TO GITHUB REPO).


Here's the brutal truth of the University of California:

**It's mostly medical centers and administrators**. Faculty make up less than ____% of the total $____ budget of the UC system. 

(LINK TO TABLEAU VIZ)

The students are spending all of their tuition on teachers. They're spending most of it on the huge teaching hospital down the street, and the legions of advisors, IT staff, and administrators in all those office buildings. Sure, patient fees and grants make up for a lot of that, but it's clear that all non-teaching activities are the tail that wags the dog. Here are some examples:


### Where Does the Money Go?

Show money by certain role, and the number of people in each role vs. number of students (student:role ratio). For example:

____people_in_role for each 1K students.



### It's About the Incentives, Stupid

I think I can see why: the incentives are all messed up.

Administrators have *no incentive* to cut their own budgets, or their staff. They'd be less important, and be able to offer less 'comprehensive' 'solutions' to (Insert Issue Here) if they did. 

I've lost count of the number of times I've heard the gnashing of teeth that some college lost a couple of places and 'prestige' in the U.S. World & News Report, and *hired somebody administrative to make things better*.

Colleges are holding onto the ___ side of the Iron Triangle (LINKME, IMAGE), and with every change their grip is getting tighter.


### Implications

* It's possible to pay faculty more, have more of them, *and* cut tuition. Just fire some administrators.
* If tuition goes up, all high-level administrators should *automatically* take a pay cut equivalent to the tuition increase.
* One way to cut tuition is to make teaching hospitals more efficient.
* All universities should have an ombudsman(LINKME) office with a sharp but thoughtful mind.
* What has been tried so far *is not working*. Let's not be insane (LINKME).

I'm very wary of suggesting more, however, because this discussion will *immediately* become political. 




#### Prove Me Wrong

I sincerely hope I'm wrong. I hope there's some massive mistake in the data, and that somehow 90%+ of the money going to a university is spent educating students.

I'm not holding my breath.
