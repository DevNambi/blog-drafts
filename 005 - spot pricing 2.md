In my last blog post, I gave an introduction into Amazon Web Services' spot instances. We found some good deals. Now, I want to look a bit at the competition.

How cheaply can I run computing with AWS' competitors?


#### Google Cloud Engine

* Figure out CPU per scaling factor for each
* How much of a discount is this compared to GCE or Azure, since they don't have this feature

#### Microsoft Azure

* Figure out CPU per scaling factor for each
* How much of a discount is this compared to GCE or Azure, since they don't have this feature

#### Rackspace

* How much of a discount is this compared to GCE or Azure, since they don't have this feature

### When In Doubt, Competition

If I was a large company, I would use *several* cloud computing solutions. My reasoning is simple: it's cheaper that way.

'Public cloud' infrastructure is incredibly expensive to build and engineer. The leaders in the field have some of the smartest engineers on the planet. The barriers to entry are *extremely* high. 

When I'm a customer of companies that have natural barriers to competition, I want there to be lots of choices. As long as many different cloud-computing companies exist, there will be [competition on price, regardless of what people say](http://recode.net/2014/11/12/amazon-cloud-chief-andy-jassy-dismisses-talk-of-price-war/). Competition leads to lower prices than monopolies; that's Economics 101 (LINKME).
