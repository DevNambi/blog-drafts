Learn from the best.


### Balance

* Mastery of a skill comes by working for long periods of time.
* Life happens while we make other plans. The unexpected is a fertile source of new ideas. 

These two statements are both true, and also contradictory. It's a struggle to find a good balance.

The assumption is that they were more than just smart. They also had a process and lessons that helped translate that intelligence into results.

"It is necessary for you to learn from others' mistakes. You will not live long enough to make them all yourself." - Hyman G. Rickover

"The way to tell a great idea is that, when people hear it, they say, 'Gee, I could have thought of that.'" â€“ Feynman, quoted by Townes
