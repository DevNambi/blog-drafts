- Analysis of brilliant people

Look for common traits
Learn from the best.


Premise: actions speak louder than words. If we want to be better, we should learn from those people who made a big impression in their time.

What general lessons do they have? What threads are there in common?

The assumption is that they were more than just smart. They also had a process and lessons that helped translate that intelligence into results.
