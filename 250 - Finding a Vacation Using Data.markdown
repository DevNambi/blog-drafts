# Quick Guide for a vacation

Kate and I were wondering about the best way to have a vacation. Also, *why* a vacation?

### Why A Vacation

People are not designed to work continuously. We certainly didn't evolve over hundreds of thousands of years to be indoors all the time, nor sitting, nor at a desk job.

Also, there's the fundamental question of: why are we here? To help our employers make money? To make the world a better place? To enjoy ourselves?

I'd argue it's the last two.

People aren't deterministic. They wear down over time. Their productivity is unpredictable, bursty, and prone to lots of different factors.

Many of the most effective engineers I know take mental health days and have lots of hobbies. They use their vacation time. They're invariably intentional about it.

Life: optimize time for X. X is what you care about. Time is what you can trade for it.

Vacations are like that.

**Implications**

* Don't go on an expensive vacation. Taking a weeklong trip to Hawaii may be pointless if you have to work for a month extra to pay for it.
* Think about end goals. 



## Cost

* Airfare
* Rental car
* Places to stay
* Luggage limitations - buying things


## Environmental impact

Airplanes - .638 to 1 pound of CO2 per passenger per mile. For both of us to fly to San Francisco (a distance of <> miles) means a CO2 footprint of <> pounds.

Driving - We drove 10,508 miles last year, using 268.4 gallons of gas. That comes to an average of 39.2 miles per gallon. We get better gas mileage on freeways because they aren't as hilly (hills are death to a Prius' gas mileage). Given that there are 19.6 pounds of CO2 in a gallon of gas, that comes out to a carbon footprint of 5261 pounds, or roughly 1/2 pound of CO2 per mile.

There is also the carbon footprint to create the car, amortized. A Prius takes about <> pounds of CO2 to make, and will be lasting us hopefully 120K to 180K miles, since we bought it with 27K miles on the car. Assuming the lifetime mileage for a Prius is about 180K miles, that comes out to <> pounds of CO2 per mile to run the car.

Rental Cars - rental cars are usually newer cars. A big part of .

If we drove to San Francisco, that'd be carbon footprint of.

There are other reasons as well.


* Don't go so fast
* Stop and enjoy the sites.
* Variety, and serendipity, are the spice of life
