# Student Housing

* Rent - everywhere nearby the UW
* Include all house sizes
* Search Craigslist, other places
* Calculate time to the UW (bus, biking, walking)
	* Not driving because we're trying to save money.
* Compare w/ dorms
* How to compare w/ time? Convert time to $-per-hour in each area when looking at student debt over the long run?
