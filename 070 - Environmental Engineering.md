### Introduction to Climate Change

* It's anthropogenic.

* Why it matters: it's a problem we'll face as we age. Our children and grandchildren will face the full brunt of the problem. They would be justified to hate us if we do nothing and condemn them to a life far worse than ours.

Oh, and there's no escaping it. Its effects will be uneven, but inescapable. 


### What Problems Will We Face?

* Lack of clean water
* Flooding cities
* Energy shortages
* Not enough food
* Refugee crises and humanitarian disasters
* Political upheavals. 
* Mass human migrations
* Political blindless to the problem
* Inability of humanity to understand the problem and its gravity.
* Inertia


### What Can We Do?

We have some lead time. Not much (years, maybe a few decades)

Systems engineering. Triage. Bottleneck analysis. 



* Desalinization technology
* Water-conservation technology
* Advocacy
* Battery technology
* Solar electricity
* Energy storage
* Public health & overpopulation
* Space travel
* Carbon capture
	ME: how much volume of carbon would we need to capture to reduce down by 10ppm in the atmosphere? Say, in a graphite form? How much for each person? How much for each city? 
* Meterology
* Climate science
* Oceanography
* Economics
* Politics

Emphasize what we don't know
