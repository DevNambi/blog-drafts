Life is an optimization problem

* No single thing is good if you scale it up infinitely.
* Very few things are good if you have nothing of them.
* There is dimishing returns everywhere.

### Examples

* Sleep
* Food
* Money
* Housing
* Exercise
* Friends
* Time spent with X
* Programming, being productive
* Playing (games, etc)

Judge everything on a scale of -3 to 3. 0 means it neither adds nor detracts from your life. 

Then it's a linear algebra problem. What do optimal solutions look like?
