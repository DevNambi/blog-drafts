## Feature Engineering

* Longtitude and Latitude as an example
* Mention deep learning
* Adding different data sets. They're often from public sources.
* Data cleansing / munging is huge. It's 80% of data science.
* Not all attributes are created equal. In fact, they are dramatically unequal. They are also only identified using ML trial and error. Design and HIPPO won't help you here.
* Goes with the idea that data is abundant.
