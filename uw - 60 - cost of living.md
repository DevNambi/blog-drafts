#### Rent 

* Per zip code
* Studio and 1-bedroom
* Sublets
* Sharing a big house
* What are the best options?
* Time to commute (bus, bike, walk)


#### Student Housing

* Rent - everywhere nearby the UW
* Include all house sizes
* Search Craigslist, other places
* Calculate time to the UW (bus, biking, walking)
    * Not driving because we're trying to save money.
* Compare w/ dorms
* How to compare w/ time? Convert time to $-per-hour in each area when looking at student debt over the long run?
* Go one level deeper than usual
* Compare to UW-provided housing. Include house price changes over time.
