## Ethics for Professionals: What and Why

* "Why should I care?"*
* "I like to work on X technology"*


"If a man isn't proud of what he does, then he isn't proud of his living" - garbageworker from the 1960's Memphis Civil Rights movement and protests.

Technical professionals have a lot of power. We only rarely consider the effects of our power and how our work is being used.

We all like to believe we are working to make our society, our world, a better place. At the very least we want to believe we aren't making things worse.


#### You Didn't Build Yourself

If you are reading this, then you're lucky enough to afford an Internet connection, which means you are most likely not starving, have a well-built home with heat, running water, and electricity. It also means you're probably a highly educated IT professional or software engineer making at least $40K a year, if not much more. That puts you in the ___% percentile of the population.

You also didn't build yourself. Chances are you had family that sacrificed to raise you, a society that paid to educate you, civic services that collectively worked to keep your community safe, warm and intact. As a child we consume resources; we don't contribute back to society until we are older.

That's fine. But saying someone is 'self-made' should mean they taught themselves without a teacher, without parents or family as guides, without police or firefighters to keep them safe. It didn't happen to you.

Imagine if you were born to a family at the midpoint of our world's population. You wouldn't have the opportunity for an education. Your parents would make ___.

We are the lucky ones. We won the lottery considering where we were born, where we grew up, and the part of society we were born into. 

"If not me, then who? If not now, then when?" (ATTRIBUTE QUOTE)

The reason you should care about ethics is twofold:

1. You're extremely lucky; you've hit the circumstantial jackpot!
2. The planet is making those chances harder.
3. At some level, you like to think of yourself as a good person.
4. If data professionals don't start behaving ethically *en masse*, the data revolution will be worse for the average person than the Industrial Revolution (REFINE). 
5. At some level you want to believe that that your compatriots and colleagues are working on the side of the angels.

#### Is your job ethical? How do you know?

That's great. Prove it.

Engineers, researchers, and IT pros are taught to use data to justify our technical instincts. Writing tests, analyzing server logs, and collecting data for scientific experiments are all examples of our understanding that *we don't know as much as the data can tell us*.

Let's apply that same principal to a different topic: ethics and work.




We live in a place with massive inequality.

* Start with a premise...we are created equal.
   * But our results are nowhere near equal, and it's not because of fate. It's partly, if not mostly, due to circumstances.
   * We live on a planet that's rapidly losing the ability to be habitable to us.
      * That's mostly for two reasons: we are consuming more per capita, and we are an overpopulated species.
      * Preventing unwanted pregnancies is a highly ethical thing to do.
      * Environment as a closed system. Optimizing under unknown constraints.
   * We live in a planet where exploiting other people is highly rewarded.
   * Most of us don't think this way. We think in terms of tools and problems. We remove the human results of our actions from the equation, because we're not comfortable with people.
   * Nobody likes to think of themselves as a bad person. So we find ways to justify our actions or explain them away.
   * You feel better knowing you're making the world a better place. It puts a spring in your step. You're glad when someone asks "Where do you work and what do you do?"
