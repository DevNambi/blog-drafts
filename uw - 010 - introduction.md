This is the first blog in a (hopefully) long series of posts on data science, analysis, data-driven discovery, and decision making at the University of Washington.

My name's Dev Nambi, and I'm a data scientist in the UW's [Enterprise Data and Analytics](LINKME) team. I've worked at the UW since 2012 in the same group. Before then I was a senior developer at Microsoft's Ads R&D group (LINKME), and before then at aQuantive, an advertising startup in Seattle. A more complete history of my exploits can be found on my personal blog [devnambi.com](http://devnambi.com). 

"The brightest minds of my generation are spent on helping people click on ads". (FIX QUOTE) <- That was me after college. I thought about working somewhere more ethical, but couldn't find anything with a salary that would let me work off my student loans.

Now, I'm working at the UW, hoping to give back to the university, and more importantly, to its students. 

### Data Science in Academia

There is quite a bit of excitement and activity (LINKS TO ANNOUNCEMENTS) on data science in academia. So far the emphasis has been, rightly, on data-driven discovery in *scientific research*. The UW is a big part of that, with its new Data Science Incubator and eScience Institute. (LINKS)

My focus is more pragmatic: I want to use data to make the University more efficient.



My reasons are simple: the tuition is too high (ADD "the tuition is too damn high meme"). Tuition is very expensive compared to starting salaries, and that problem has been getting worse for *decades* (ADD GRAPH). Student debt now 

**Assertion**: No civilization should burden its young people with unavoidable debts as a prerequisite to becoming productive members of society. It's heinous, and idiotically short-sighted.


There have been endless news articles on this topic, mostly focusing on the problem of student debt, the endless rise of tuition, and the slow disinvestment of state governments in higher education. I won't go dive into that; I'd recommend a Google News search and some antacid if you want to know more (LINK).

**Where Does the Money Go?**
**It's About the Money, Stupid**

Am I afraid I will make enemies, or be fired? Honestly? No, not really. I certainly don't want to offend anyone, and I like to think I'm good at my job.
