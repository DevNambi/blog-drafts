# The Bootstrap


This is the first post in a blog on data analysis, data-driven discovery, and decision making at the University of Washington.

My name's Dev Nambi, and I'm a data scientist in the UW's [Enterprise Data and Analytics](http://www.washington.edu/uwit/im/EDA.html) team. (ADD PIC) I've worked at the UW since 2012. Before that I was a software developer and analyst at [Microsoft's Ads](http://advertising.microsoft.com/en/advertising-online) R&D group, an ETL developer at a startup, and [more](http://devnambi.com). 

*"The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads..." - [Jeff Hammerbacher](https://twitter.com/hackingdata)*

That was me. It the best job I could find that paid enough to let me work off my student loans. Now I am hoping to give back to the next generation of students at the university. 


### Data Science in Academia

There is quite a bit of [excitement](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2013/11/12/uw-berkeley-nyu-collaborate-on-37-8m-data-science-initiative/) and [activity](http://escience.washington.edu/event/data-science-university-washington-campus-conversation) on data science in academia. So far the emphasis has been, rightly, on data-driven discovery in *scientific research*. The UW's emphasis there is its new [Data Science Incubator](http://data.uw.edu) and [eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/). 

There are potentially far-reaching implications in fields as varied as astrophysics, oceanography, chemical engineering, genomics, and sociology.

I admire that, but I want to do something more pragmatic, more *direct*.


### Data Science in Administration

A university can be made more efficient using data. There are so many ways to do this it's mind-boggling, so I use a heuristic to pick areas to focus on: changes must directly benefit students.

My reason for starting with students is simple: money.

(ADD "the tuition is too damn high meme"). 


Tuition is very expensive [compared to entry-level salaries](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-18/net-worth-college-grads-student-debt-20-less-high-school-grads-no-debt), and that problem has been getting worse for *[decades](http://measuringup2008.highereducation.org/commentary/callan.php)*. Student debt is now [bigger than credit card debt](http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/blog/2013/04/fed-student-loan-debt-surpasses-auto.html), and it's [practically impossible to get rid of](http://www.studentloanborrowerassistance.org/bankruptcy/).

My goal is simple: to find ways to help UW students graduate with the same quality education they have now, but with less debt.
