# Bootstrapping.


This is the first post in a (hopefully) long-running blog on data science, analysis, data-driven discovery, and decision making at the University of Washington.

My name's Dev Nambi, and I'm a data scientist in the UW's [Enterprise Data and Analytics](LINKME) team. (ADD PIC) I've worked at the UW since 2012. Before that I was a software developer and analyst at Microsoft's Ads R&D group (LINKME), an ETL developer at a startup, and [more](http://devnambi.com). 

*"The brightest minds of my generation are spent on helping people click on ads."* (FIX QUOTE, ATTRIBUTE) 

That was me. I thought about working somewhere more ethical, more *useful*, but couldn't find anything else that paid enough to let me work off my student loans. 

Now, though, I am hoping to give back to the next generation of students at the university. 


### Data Science in Academia

There is quite a bit of excitement and activity (LINKS TO ANNOUNCEMENTS) on data science in academia. So far the emphasis has been, rightly, on data-driven discovery in *scientific research*. The UW's emphasis there is its new [Data Science Incubator](http://data.uw.edu) and [eScience Institute](LINK). 

There are potentially far-reaching implications in fields as varied as astrophysics, oceanography, chemical engineering, genomics, and sociology.

I admire that, but I want to do something more pragmatic, more *direct*.


### Data Science in *Administration*

A less heralded area of work, though, is to make a university more efficient using data. There are so many ways to do this it's mind-boggling, so I use a simple heuristic: all changes must directly benefit students.


(ADD "the tuition is too damn high meme"). 

Tuition is very expensive compared to starting salaries, and that problem has been getting worse for *decades* (ADD GRAPH). Student debt is now larger than credit card debt, and it's nigh-impossible to get rid of. (LINKS)
