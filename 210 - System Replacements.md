# System Replacements

* Have to keep the old system online
* The people you have aren't always the people you need
* It's cruel to hire folks for the new system and fire the old folks.
* Vendor or temporary hires aren't good options because of misaligned incentives.

The big way forward I can see is good, flexible design at the beginning. That, and training your existing folks to incrementally build a new system and acquire new skills

* There's a thing about expectations vs. reality when it comes to timing, due dates and deliverables.
