## The Seattle Art Museum, Data-Style


* What are the business questions?
* Look at it as a data-analyis problem. Coursera class reference for that.
* Enumerate the data *science* part of that. The scientific method.

How can data help the Seattle Aquarium? 

*This was a thought exercise early in my last University of Washington [Data Science class](http://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/data-science.html)*.

### In the Beginning was the Context

The goal of the [Seattle Aquarium](http://seattleartmuseum.org) (SAM) is *"a welcome place for people to connect with art and to consider its relationship to their lives."*. Art is undergoing critical challenges. The emphasis of STEM in schools and civil discourse has de-emphasized (and often de-funded) arts for the next generation. 

(IMAGE: what's a painting?)

The amount of content people consume is increasing, but it's largely driven by the Internet. Art museums can't currently compete against [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) for mass appeal.

People aren't doing very well, either. The median family has *less* income and job stability than 30 years ago, even as the GDP is up (INSERT) and the stock market is up (INSERT). Unless you happen to be a millionaire, you have bigger things on your mind than art.


### Art and Relevance

Currently [INSERT]% of people say art is relevant in their lives (LINK TO SOURCE). In 2011 SAM had 600K visitors, which is ~16% of the Seattle metro population. Chances are it's a far smaller number of actual people, since many visitors are tourists or repeat customers. A more telling figure is the number of members, 48K, which is ~1.3% of the population. That was also the most popular year SAM had ever had because of their Picasso exhibit.

I asked 30 random people in downtown Seattle what they thought about the art museum, which was less than 3 blocks away.

1. 14 of them didn't know there was an art museum there
2. 13 of them had never been there, and didn't seem interested
3. 3 had been to the art museum, but wouldn't go again soon because "it's too expensive" and "it wasn't that interesting"
4. 0 knew it was there and would go again.

*The plural of anecdote is not data.*

However, this experience was illuminating. Most people don't think of art, let alone in their daily routine. 





### Goals


* Make SAM more interesting to *everyone*
* Make SAM more relevant to people
* Make SAM more 'sticky' to existing visitors

**Secondary Goals**

* Make SAM more profitable. to be achieved by making SAM more attractive to the general public. More admissions = more money.

You'll notice a non-goal is to make SAM more profitable. It's a secondary goal, because there's no point in having a rich museum that nobody visits.

This can be broken into two goals:

1. Make art interesting to more people
2. Make SAM more appealing to existing art lovers





### Ask Better Questions

**Questions**

* What the demographics / characteristics of existing SAM visitors?
* What kinds of art does each demographic like?
* What kinds of art are like each other? Can we tell based on visitor behavior instead of 
* Who visits the SAM website? From where? Is it mobile-friendly?
* Can we make SAM the star attraction as part of a digital ecosystem? Have an app or a mobile-friendly site that makes it easy for people to spend time on the site?
* Can we 'inject' art into people's lives? How do we do that?
* Can social media be used to make art relevant in the right context? How?


### Resources and Constraints

Let's go over the resources and constraints that SAM has to work with.

**Advantages:**

* Name recognition...sort of.
* Location
* Organizational structure / resilience
* People are primed to look at visual content
* ___% of people in Seattle have smartphones (LINK)
* ___$ of people in Seattle have an Internet connection. It has become almost as ubiquitous as electricity.
* The median tourist makes $___ per year. The median income for smartphone owners is $____. Therefore (using a little Bayesian math) we can guess that %_____  of tourists have smartphones.
* 
 
**Challenges:**

* Low budget
* Irrelevance for upcoming generations
* Disinterested audience
* Cost


**Tools:**

Tools are an interesting category. They can be used to great effect, or not. They also change business dynamics because 

* Pinterest 
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Get local artists involved
* Get families involved.
   * Make an art-style play area for kids
   * Have tasty food nearby
   * Get involved with Art Thursday
* Become involved in nontraditional art. For example, Internet memes (cats throughout the centuries), (what makes certain photos and expressions so appealing and timeless)







### Using Data to Answer Questions

This isn't a new idea. The History Colorado Museum paired with some [data analysis pros to identify its customers and tailor its exhibits to them](http://arstechnica.com/sponsored/big-data-analytics-revitalizes-colorado-museum/). The result: its visitors and membership *doubled*.


#### Data Science

The heart of data science is the scientific method (LINK). That means running experiments; changing one thing and seeing if that one difference causes significant changes.

To make art more interesting to more people we need to know more about each visitor and how they respond to existing art and programming.


* Start tracking which online users visit SAM. Make the handheld free, and track who goes to which exhibit and for how long. 

Some tactics I would use are:
* Sell SAM tickets at a slight discount online. However, to use the discount people need to create an account. Doing so gives us a valid email address, home address and phone number. 
* Sell SAM tickets at a slight discount the chance to win a raffle to people who 'like' the SAM Facebook page, or tweet about it. 
* Use social techniques to bring in the friends and family of existing visitors. Facebook integration is an obvious approach, where people can post on Facebook that they are going to the Seattle Aquarium immediately after purchasing a ticket.
* SAM has a computerized audio guide . It can be much more. If tied to the email address or name of the visitor, it can tell the museum which exhibits were seen, and for how long. This would tell the museum which exhibits were popular to which people. 

The goal is to build profiles (groups, clusters) of attendees based on their behavior, including . 


### Result

**Make art interesting to more people**

This is a classic sales goal. Data science and a website could help because increasing numbers of people are online. 

Start recording and measuring how different outreach strategies work, by using people's names, emails or Facebook identities to track whether they visit the museum or not. 

Give visitors an incentive to . For example, bundle museum visits

**Make SAM more appealing to existing art lovers**

* Offer different tiers of membership, tailored to existing art lovers' interests. 
* Use observation and experimentation of different kinds of programming to try different things. 


## Detritus

I am running a site promoting the Seattle Aquarium, it includes content that users can click through to read about current exhibits, serve up ad impressions (% paid to SAM), ticket sales, PSAs, donation button.

Write 1-2 paragraphs (minimum) answering the following: How could the SAM take advantage of trends in technology, data science and evaluation to gather & analyze the sort of data that could help not only measure its success, but to help achieve its mission? Thinking outside the box encouraged, what would you apply from this evening's lecture?




**Notes**

* http://www.fastcoexist.com/1682034/one-infographic-that-proves-the-art-world-is-stunningly-sexist?utm_source=twitter
* Recommendation system for people for art. Also use that to guide future exhibits.
* Mechanisms: social media(?). Tailor different mechanism to people who like 
* Economics: discounts to people who buy tickets on the site & subscribe to an email newsletter, or hit 'like' on Facebook. Start building up profiles of visitors to the site.
* Start using this to analyze which demographics of people like which art. You can also use this to associate which types of art are popular with the same groups of visitors (association rules).
* Start building up information on demographics of who donates, and what kind of art they like. Also look at different geographic areas.
