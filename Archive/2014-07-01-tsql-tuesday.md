It's hard to rock the boat. <br /> It's hard to ask the basic questions that everybody knows. <br />It's hard to slow down and ask for clarification.

So, we improvise. We guess: things that are accepted as true, without proof. We often forget our assumptions, or make them instinctively. 

For this T-SQL Tuesday, the topic is **assumptions**. 


For example:

* The sun will come up tomorrow.
* Firewalls and anti-virus are enough to protect my computer.
* My backups work even if I don't restore them.
* I don't need to check for *that* error, it'll never happen.

Your assignment for this month is to write about a big assumption you encounter at work, one that people are uncomfortable talking about. Every team has an [elephant in the room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room). 


**What happens if these big guesses aren't true?**
