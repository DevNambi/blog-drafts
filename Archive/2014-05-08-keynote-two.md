* Too large to really understand. Billion dollar-o-gram. Color are 
* The story is the connections between normally unconnected data.
* Cost per taxpayer per day. It's a number and scale we can relate to.

$148 billion. Spent on obesity-related illness. 

Data is the new soil. Things grow from them.

You need journalistic inquiry to deliver discovery and delivery.

Break-up times: never on Xmas,

We learn different things by osmosis.

Our brains interact in visual color, pattern and shape. It's the language of our brain. 75% of neurons (check that).

Venn diagram - pigs, birds, humans - in-flu-venza. Wow, that's a terrible pun.

**Twitter IPO**

100 people
20 are dead
60 lazy - not in last week
5 with more than 10- followers
5 loud mouths - 32% are bots
55 women, 45 men.


200 billion hours TV. 100 million hours to create Wikipedia. 

his data is all public. Use it.

Food supplement by efficacy.

**Fail Tips**

* When you visualize a complex data set, you make a complex graphic. Doesn't solve it.
* Circular diagrams aren't that usable. 
* Cartograms...hard to get the data out. Very hard to compare.
* Design is really about removing things, cleaning down to a functional essence.

**What Works**

* Interestingness - goes after a useful question
* Integrity - trustworthy
* Form - has to look good, certain standard. 
* Function - easy to use


* Data viz smackdown
* Hard to write - so engrossing. Mark of a brilliant keynote.

* All datasets are public on Google Docs. They spend a lot of time putting it together.
