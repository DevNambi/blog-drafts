# UW - Finance


**Assertion**: No civilization should burden its young people with unavoidable debts as a prerequisite to becoming productive members of society. It's heinous, and criminally short-sighted.

There have been endless news articles on this topic, mostly focusing on the problem of student debt, the endless rise of tuition, and the slow disinvestment of state governments in higher education. I won't go dive into that; I'd recommend a Google News search and some antacid if you want to know more (LINK).

One of the things I find lacking, though, is that all of this news only focuses on higher education **revenue**, and not **expenses**.

**Where Does the Money Go?**

Honestly? I don't know. My focus at the UW thus far has been on academic data, and not financial. I'll look at expenses at some point. 

In the meantime, what can a university and its staff do to reduce student debt aside from lowering tuition?

I can think of a few things:

* Reduce the time-to-graduate for all students. 
* Make it easier for students to pick a major
* Make sure critical classes don't fill up. 
* Predict when a student is likely to drop out of college, and take steps to intervene. One of the worst outcomes for a student is to have lots of debt and no degree.
