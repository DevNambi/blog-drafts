### Intro

Technical professionals have great power. But we don't consider our effect on society.

We believe we are working to make our society, our world, a better place. At the very least we believe we aren't making things worse. We try and behave **ethically**.

## What Do People Want?

People are complicated, unpredictable, muddled creatures. We often don't know what we want, and rarely have the self-awareness to articulate it. We also respond in a very subjective fashion, placing immediate concerns disproportionately higher than larger, longer-term concerns. (This is why credit cards exist).

There's a famous framework that describes what human beings need, a **Hierarchy of Needs**.

(INSERT IMAGE OF MASLOW'S PYRAMID)


* What do people want most? - Maslow's hierarchy of needs
What are fundamental human rights?
   * Air
   * Water
   * Shelter?
   * Clothing?
   * Food?
   * Medicine?
   * Internet?
   * Vacations?
   * Netflix?


Now, let's create the opposite, Dev's ??? of ????:

1. Polluted air, polluted water, unsafe/unstable housing, inadequate clothing.
2. Not enough food, non-nutritious food, untested food. Lack of access to medicine and medical care.
3. ...CONTINUE
(INCLUDE IMAGES).

How important are each of these? They're not equal; that's a pyramid for a reason. I'd argue that it's not a power-law distribution; lack of housing isn't 10X worse than lack of food. Let's use a log-5 scale (CHECK): each tier is five times as important as the tier above it. 

"First: There are no sacred truths; all assumptions must be critically examined; arguments from authority are worthless"
"Second: whatever is inconsistent with facts must be discarded or revised..."


### For Better or Worse is Usually Worse

Humans are risk-averse. It's a fact of life. We also focus on the negative more than the positive.

(INCLUDE RISK AVERSION RATIO, NEGATIVITY RATIO).

This is important because we should account for it. If I'm a doctor that treats a patient's broken leg and bills them into bankruptcy, what do you think that person will remember most? Their healed leg, or the life in poverty?


### Measuring Industry Impact

Let's measure each industry, and assign a value to them.

(INSERT IMAGE).

However, no business works in a vacuum; they all interact with one another. Suddenly we have a *network* instead of a list.

If I have N (INSERT) industries that link together, and have different association weights (REFINE), then I want to *transfer* some of the weight around to compensate for it. 

There's a famous way to do this: PageRank. This is the same problem as having different web pages that link to each other with different weights. So let's use that. (ACCOUNT FOR INDUSTRY SIZE? CALCULATE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SEPARATELY?)



### Measuring Neutrality

We can use this to measure something else: the effect of building tools. Let's say we build a frameework or tool, called Gorilla. 


* Online ads and SEO as the cruft of society?
* If you just build tools, look at what industries they're used in. Then use Bayesian math to figure out if your effect is unethical. For example, if you build a better big data engine, what % of big data engines are used for the NSA or online ad serving?
