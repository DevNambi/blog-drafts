# College from First Principles



### How much should college cost?

NOTE: this is a later blog post

Let's look at colleges and universities from a student's perspective. What matters most of all is:

* A degree they can show future employers
* Good professors and teaching aides
* A safe place to learn

*Everything* else is optional. 

I'm going to shamelessly copy Elon Musk's idea of [analyzing cost from first principles](LINKME) from first principles.

**Cost of a large university degree**

University professors
TAs / grad students
Cost to rent a building in a suburb.
Cost to rent a studio in a suburb

**Cost of a small liberal-arts degree**

University professors
TAs / grad students
Cost to rent a building in a sleepy 'college' town.
Cost to rent a house and share it in a sleepy 'college' town.
Better student:teacher ratio


**Cost of a 2-year, 'intensive' degree**

* Rise of coding schools
* Smaller staff.
* Cost to rent

Cost of higher ed from first principles:



*Full disclosure: I am a staff member at the University of Washington. I acknowledge that this may cause some bias; I have tied to stick to the facts in an attempt to counter this.*


#### Gender Balance

Use gender-prediction API (name?) to figure out gender per name. Use that to find gender balance per title, per category, and overall. Also look at salary imbalance.
