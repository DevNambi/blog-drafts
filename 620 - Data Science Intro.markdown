# Summary

Machine learning is a way to find meaning in data. This is a fun and gentle introduction to the world of machine learning. You'll learn to implement common techniques in T-SQL and solve everyday problems.

# Abstract

Machine learning is a hybrid of computer science and math. It's used everywhere: web search (Google, Bing), recommendation engines (Netflix, Amazon, LinkedIn), computational vision (self-driving cars), and natural language processing (Google Translate, Klout).

The basics of machine learning are simple. You don't need to be a level 18 data scientist to use machine learning to solve problems. 

Join fellow data geek Dev Nambi in this fun and gentle introduction to the world of machine learning. We will cover common techniques such as clustering, supervised vs unsupervised learning, and learning at scale. Finally, you'll learn how to implement common machine learning techniques in T-SQL.

### Abandoned Abstracts

'Data Science' is the all the rage these days. Most of the people I've spoken with are hesitant, probably because they weren't good at math.

All of the techniques in data science are pretty intuitive once you see what they're about.

This session will be a fast introduction to the world of data science. 

We'll look at the software side of things, including feature extraction and rapid prototyping.

We'll look at the business side of things, including 

We'll also dive into its use, including clustering, recommender systems, natural language processing, and computer vision. 

Machine learning is the science of building predictive models from available data, in order to predict the behavior of new data.

It's all about scripting
Quick and dirty is the point.

## Common Perspectives

It's about the scientific method
You don't know what's going to work ahead of time
	Experience makes you stop asking stupid questions. But you can get jaded
	Curiosity helps you ask stupid questions.


## Applications

Natural language processing
Searching for correlations
Grouping together alike objects
	Pricing
	Behavior
Identifying unexpected relationships
	System linkages (splunk)
	Purchasing behavior (retailers, Amazon)
	People (dating, LinkedIn, recruiter)
	Music (Pandora)
	Movies (Netflix)
