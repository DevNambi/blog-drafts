# UW - Time to Graduate

In my last post (LINK), I introduced myself 


There are several general themes underway discussing how to help students graduate with less student debt:

* Add more money, usually in the form of student loans/grants and state funding. (LINKS)
* Privatize higher education, making 'the market' solve the problem. Initial results show them to be *worse* for their students, and better for shareholders, than public higher education (ADD LINKS).
* MOOCs and online learning, which scale far more than in-person education. Funny, though, the results aren't very compelling. It makes me wonder if the in-person, doesn't-scale part of higher education is where a lot of the value is. (ADD LINKS)

I have no particular preference towards any approach, as long as it works. However, there are already plenty of people working on each of these areas, so I want to try something else:

### It's About Time

Universities don't have set prices for a degree; they charge tuition per quarter, per semester, or per year. Public universities are often funded in a similar way; they receive a certain amount per student enrolled. 

If students can graduate faster without losing the quality of their education, then everybody benefits. Students graduate with less student debt, and additional time in their lives. Universities can admit more students. Federal and state coffers don't have to pay as much.

### The Challenge of Choice

The University of Washington, like many universities, offers many different areas of specialization (majors), leading to different credentials (degrees). Currently the UW offers over (150, CHECKME) majors. 

How do students pick which courses to take, which majors to pursue, what research to do?

There's a lot of research that suggests humans don't respond well when given too many choices (ADD CITIATIONS). One of the big reasons is physiological; we can only keep (5-7, LINKME) options in working memory at a time. 


### Options

There are several areas where the time-to-graduate can be improved, because the existing processes haven't been optimized for efficiency.

**Help first-year students pick majors**

* Palette of courses. 
* Pick courses with high information gain (entropy)
* Recommend courses and majors in an intuitive, transparent way.
* MyPlan

**Help transfer students plan transfers**

Transfer efficiency
Major-specific requirements
MyPlan for everyone

**Make the major-admittance process easier**

* Make GPA admits transparent
* Public data concerns. Transcripts are privileged. But their aggregated/anonymized data shouldn't be.

**Better allocate teaching resources to courses**

* Course demand, bottleneck courses
* Predict it.
* Figure out when to offer courses
