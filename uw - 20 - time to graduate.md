# UW - Time to Graduate

In my [last post](http://blogs.uw.edu/fractals/introduction/), I introduced myself and gave some background into data science in academia. Now, let's look at one big 


*"Always work on the thing with the highest leverage" - Aaron Swartz* (FIX_QUOTE)

Student debt is one of the big stories of our time. There are several broad discussions happening now:

* Recognize that the very idea of student debt is repugnant, both morally and pragmatically. 
* Add more money, usually in the form of additional state/federal funding. However, I don't know of any examples of when doing so made tuition or student debt *decrease*. (LINKS)
* Privatize higher education, letting 'the market' solve the problem. Unfortunately, this has been tried with for-profit colleges, and the results are terrifyingly bad. Students see an inferior academic experience, learn less, have fewer career opportunities and higher debt loads. (ADD LINKS).
* Trust to MOOCs and online learning, which scale far better than traditional, in-person education. Funny, though, the results aren't very impressive yet (LINK). I wonder what about the in-person, doesn't-scale part of education that is hard/impossible to duplicate on a computer. (ADD LINKS)

I have no particular preference or aversion to any of these on principle, but they darn well better **make the situation better**. 

## And Now for Something Completely Different

I wonder if public universities can be [made more efficient](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/08/20/consultants-best-case-scenarios-rarely-reality). Can a university reduce the time to graduate for its students? Can it reduce the price of tuition by better allocating existing resources?


**It's About Time**

Colleges don't have a fixed price for a degree; they charge for each day/quarter/year you're enrolled. Each year, students have to adjust their finances to handle different sets of loans, grants, and tuition rates. State funding is similar: public institutions are often funded by giving a certain amount per student, per year.

If students could graduate faster without sacrificing the quality of their education, then everyone would benefit. Students would graduate with less debt and more time in their lives. Federal and state coffers would pay less per student, allowing scarce government funds to go further. Universities could admit more students with their increased capacity.

Let's ask a broad question: **what are the barriers, good and bad, that prevent students from graduating quickly?**

### Hoops and Hurdles

Some barriers to graduation are necessary. *Learning* takes time. Research and discovery take time. The ever-more-numerous specialities in modern society each take more training (read: time) to master before an individual is prepared to contribute. 

Some barriers to graduation are unnecessary. Required courses may be full. Students could explore courses aimlessly before choosing a major (specialization). Some majors may not accept many students, leading to cycles of self-doubt and further searching. 


### The Challenge of Choice

The University of Washington, like many universities, offers many different areas of specialization (majors), leading to different credentials (degrees). Currently the UW offers over (150, CHECKME) majors. 

How do students pick which courses to take, which majors to pursue, what research to do?

There's a lot of research that suggests humans don't respond well when given too many choices (ADD CITIATIONS). One of the big reasons is physiological; we can only keep (5-7, LINKME) options in working memory at a time. 


### Options

There are several areas where the time-to-graduate can be improved, because the existing processes haven't been optimized for efficiency.

**Help first-year students pick majors**

* Palette of courses. 
* Pick courses with high information gain (entropy)
* Recommend courses and majors in an intuitive, transparent way.
* MyPlan

**Help transfer students plan transfers**

* Transfer efficiency
* Major-specific requirements
* MyPlan for everyone

**Make the major-admittance process easier**

* Make GPA admits transparent
* Public data concerns. Transcripts are privileged. But their aggregated/anonymized data shouldn't be.

**Better allocate teaching resources to courses**

* Course demand, bottleneck courses
* Predict it.
* Figure out when to offer courses

**Teach things students need for a career**
