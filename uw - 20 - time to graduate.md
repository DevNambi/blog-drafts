# UW - Time to Graduate

In my [last post](http://blogs.uw.edu/fractals/introduction/), I introduced myself and gave some background about data science in academia. This time, I want to look at one challenge: the time to graduate.

## Leverage

*"Always work on the thing with the highest leverage" - Aaron Swartz* (FIX_QUOTE)

I wonder if public universities can be [made more efficient](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/08/20/consultants-best-case-scenarios-rarely-reality). Can a university reduce the time to graduate for its students? Can it reduce the total price of a degree by better allocating existing resources?


**It's About Time**

Colleges don't have fixed prices for degrees; they charge for each day/quarter/year you're enrolled. Students adjust their finances each year to handle different combinations of loans, scholarships, grants, and tuition. State funding is similar: public institutions are often funded by giving a certain amount per student, per year.

Everyone would benefit if students graduate faster without sacrificing the quality of their education. Students would have less debt, governments would spend less per student, and universities would have a greater capacity to admit students. 


### The Six-Year Metric

Universities are often judged by the percentage of 4-year students who graduate within *six* years.

Think about that for a minute. Why would a 4-year degree take six years? And why on earth are universities given 50% slack?

* 30-year mortgages paid off within 45 years
* 30 mpg cars that get at least 20 miles a gallon
* The % of 2-hour flights that don't take longer than 3 hours
* Cooking?
* Commuting?
* 8-hour workdays that finish in less than 12 hours
* 40-hour workweeks that take less than 60 hours/week
* 


**What are the barriers, good and bad, that prevent students from graduating quickly?**

### Hoops and Hurdles

Some barriers to graduation are necessary. *Learning* takes time. Research and discovery take time. The ever-more-numerous specialities in modern society each take more training (read: time) to master before an individual is prepared to contribute. 

Some barriers to graduation are unnecessary. Required courses may be full. Students could explore courses aimlessly before choosing a major (specialization). Some majors may not accept many students, leading to cycles of self-doubt and further searching. 


### The Challenge of Choice

The University of Washington, like many universities, offers many different areas of specialization (majors), leading to different credentials (degrees). Currently the UW offers over (150, CHECKME) majors. 

How do students pick which courses to take, which majors to pursue, what research to do?

There's a lot of research that suggests humans don't respond well when given too many choices (ADD CITIATIONS). One of the big reasons is physiological; we can only keep (5-7, LINKME) options in working memory at a time. 


### Options

There are several areas where the time-to-graduate can be improved, because the existing processes haven't been optimized for efficiency.

**Help first-year students pick majors**

* Palette of courses. 
* Pick courses with high information gain (entropy)
* Recommend courses and majors in an intuitive, transparent way.
* MyPlan

**Help transfer students plan transfers**

* Transfer efficiency
* Major-specific requirements
* MyPlan for everyone

**Make the major-admittance process easier**

* Make GPA admits transparent
* Public data concerns. Transcripts are privileged. But their aggregated/anonymized data shouldn't be.

**Better allocate teaching resources to courses**

* Course demand, bottleneck courses
* Predict it.
* Figure out when to offer courses

**Teach things students need for a career**
