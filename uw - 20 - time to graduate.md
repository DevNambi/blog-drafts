# UW - Time to Graduate

In my [last post](http://blogs.uw.edu/fractals/introduction/), I introduced myself and gave some background into data science in academia. Let's delve into some details.


Many, many people have discussed the challenge of student debt and the cost of tuition. There are several broad discussions happening now about what to do:

* Add more money, usually in the form of additional state funding. I have yet to see an example of when this made tuition or student debt *decrease*.(LINKS)
* Privatize higher education, making 'the market' solve the problem. Unfortunately, most results show for-profit colleges to have *far worse* outcomes than public higher education, resulting in fewer career opportunities and higher debt loads for their students. (ADD LINKS).
* MOOCs and online learning, which scale far better than traditional, in-person education. Funny, though, the results aren't very impressive yet (LINK). I wonder what about the in-person, doesn't-scale part of education that is hard/impossible to duplicate on a computer. (ADD LINKS)

There are several other approaches, but these are the big ones. I have no particular preference or aversion to any of them, **if they make the situation better**. However, there are already plenty of people working on each of these areas, so I'm trying something else: efficiency.

### The Goals of Education

* Civic: Create an informed citizenry
* Vocational: Preparation for a career (vocational)
* Personal: Growth and fulfillment.

### It's About Time

Colleges don't have a fixed prices for a degree; they charge tuition per quarter, per semester, or per year. Each year, students have to adjust their finances to handle different sets of loans, grants, and tuition rates. State funding is similar: public institutions are often funded by giving a certain amount per student.

If students can graduate faster without sacrificing the quality of their education, then everybody benefits. Students graduate with less student debt. Federal and state coffers don't have to pay as much. Universities can admit more students with their increased capacity.

Let's ask a broad question: **what are the barriers, good and bad, that prevent students from graduating quickly?**

### Hoops and Hurdles

Some barriers to graduation are good, and in fact necessary. Learning is itself a barrier; it takes time to learn a subject, and become adept in its complexity. The endless amounts of homework, papers and projects should inculcate (CHECK USAGE) both skill and the ability to learn in students.

Some barriers are largely unavoidable. The ever-smaller specialities present in a developed economy only increase the amount of training necessary before someone has the necessary skills to contribute professionally.

Some barriers are bad. 

### The Challenge of Choice

The University of Washington, like many universities, offers many different areas of specialization (majors), leading to different credentials (degrees). Currently the UW offers over (150, CHECKME) majors. 

How do students pick which courses to take, which majors to pursue, what research to do?

There's a lot of research that suggests humans don't respond well when given too many choices (ADD CITIATIONS). One of the big reasons is physiological; we can only keep (5-7, LINKME) options in working memory at a time. 


### Options

There are several areas where the time-to-graduate can be improved, because the existing processes haven't been optimized for efficiency.

**Help first-year students pick majors**

* Palette of courses. 
* Pick courses with high information gain (entropy)
* Recommend courses and majors in an intuitive, transparent way.
* MyPlan

**Help transfer students plan transfers**

* Transfer efficiency
* Major-specific requirements
* MyPlan for everyone

**Make the major-admittance process easier**

* Make GPA admits transparent
* Public data concerns. Transcripts are privileged. But their aggregated/anonymized data shouldn't be.

**Better allocate teaching resources to courses**

* Course demand, bottleneck courses
* Predict it.
* Figure out when to offer courses

**Teach things students need for a career**
