## Polyglot Engineering


I have met many, many developers and IT engineers who think their job is something new. It's not. The practices involved in working with computers are new mixes of ancient techniques.

I am inspired by Max Shron's excellent book, *Thinking with Data* (LINK). Max describes the linkages between data analysis and rhetoric, industrial design, and communication.

### Teams

Very, very few software projects or systems are built by one person. The vast majority of the time a team is involved.

Software engineering requires **psychology** and **social awareness**. The same traits you find in 8-year-olds when building a sand castle. Here are some of the "new" skills:

* An awareness of people's emotions
* Knowledge of how people communicate
* Recognizing and developing

Software engineering is **education**. You should always be learning; a new codebase, new techniques, new ideas. These build upon your current understand. You'll also be teaching your peers or new hires.

* Teaching
* The Socratic Method
* Documentation is like preparing curriculum. 

Software engineering is **communication**. The ongoing effort to hear what people mean, not just what you hear. Asking precise, probing questions to get to the heart of the matter. Modulating your own communication style to match your audience. 


### Self Awareness

*You* build computer products. Your body, brain and reason are involved in the endeavor. 

Software engineering is about **self awareness**. Don't write emails when you're angry. Try to control your ego and hubris when writing code, so it doesn't become overly complicated.

* Self-awareness. Religion. Meditation


Software engineering is about **nutrition**. Eat healthy food so your brain's chemical pathways function well. Exercise so you have energy after you're done with your work. 


### Science

Software engineering borrows many, many things from science.

Troubleshooting and debugging are the same as the scientific method.

Designing a computer application is awfully similar to designing an experiment.

Data analysis in science and engineering are *exactly the same*.

Algorithms and data structures are applied math.

Explaining your data analysis is like journalism.

### Craft

My best lessons in engineering came when I learned carpentry from my grandfather. He posed challenges and let me solve them multiple times, in different ways. That was a great series of lessons in complexity, the sublime beauty of good design, and the balance required between form and function.
