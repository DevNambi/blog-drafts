# The 'Efficiency' Dystopia


I hear a lot about 'efficiency' and 'progress'. My question, inevitably, is: who benefits? What does it cost? Do the benefits outweigh the costs?

One of the biggest names in 'efficiency' and 'customer focus' is [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com). However, their relentless 'customer service' comes at a horrific price for the warehouse workers they 'employ'.

This isn't limited to the U.S. In Germany, which has a strong union tradition, workers (read: people) are protesting [because the working conditions are inhumane](http://seattletimes.com/html/specialreportspages/2024340124_amazongermanyxml.html). Clearly this is because Germans are well known to be good-for-nothing slackers. 

In the U.K, the BBC did an [undercover investigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXWJ4GfQ22E) to show what working at one of the warehouses is like.

It is painfully obvious that the people who work to deliver goods for Amazon aren't treated like people; they are treated like cogs, to be worn down and discarded, because *there are always more cogs*. Letting people work at a sane pace, giving them access to medical care, heat, or decent bathroom breaks would put a (miniscule) dent in the bottom line. 

This is a more profitable way to run a business. That's the goal, right?
