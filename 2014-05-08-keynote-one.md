The [PASS Business Analytics conference](http://www.sqlpass.org/bac/2014/Home.aspx) (ADD IMAGE) has started. I had the privilege of watching the [keynote](http://www.sqlpass.org/bac/2014/Sessions/Keynote.aspx) with 600-700 fellow data nerds. 

I was also playing [Data Science Bingo](https://github.com/tdhopper/Data-Science-Conference-Bingo).

Good lord, too many pie charts.

Everyone wants to get more out of their data.

Of course, we started off with Tom LaRock (t/b). 

"We get paid to work with data every day" (Tom LaRock)

### Getting Involved

We're a bunch of like-minded pros.

Virtual Chapters

SQL Saturdays

There's a niche for you.

Next year - April 20-22 in Santa Clara.

### "Big Data, Predictive Analytics, and the Middle Market"

[John Whittaker](https://twitter.com/alertsource) 

Sr. Dir. IM from Dell Software

300 respondents, 96% said that they had big-data projects in flight or were to launch them this year.

Budgets range around 2-5 million. Within 2 years they'll be at the $6mil level.

**What drives success?**

* 41% strong cooperation between businss and IT
* 37 - strong connection between data analystics and perf mgmt
* Required skills - data science - 33
* Bus req complete/accurate - 32
* Server/storage capacity -30%
* Datacenter tools capable 29%

Unknown - 

Very easy to be clever w/ predictive analytics. Just as easy to be creepy with it.

**What are the most useful tools?**

60% real-time processing
58% predictive
56% data viz to convert processed daa into actionable insights
56% cloud computing for lower cost


ME - get the keynote slides!

**Main challenge**

Complexity, volume, budget

Data complexity - where it is, cleaning it, etc is still one of the big unsolved challenges today.

50% of organizations with big data projects in flight are satisfied with their decision making (speed quality), compared to just 23% among those yet to kick off a project.

Who should decide: split between IT and biz.


### Bingo Words

* "Big Data"
* "Complexity"
* "Volume of data"
* "Real time"
* "Hadoop"
* "NoSQL"

# Amir Netz, Kamal Hathi

Amir - chief designer for data platform
Kamal (@kamalh) - director of engineering for BI

We have an engineer as a MSFT CEO - is it soon enough?

Talk about Microsoft culture. 


2 mil power pivot
100K power query
55K power map
only looking at downloads
HDinsight - 100mil compute hours
powerBI 365 - 12.5K tenants activated (companies)
no 1 market share gain 2013 Gartner BI market share report.

We've gone meta

Tenants by date - up to around 12K tenants. Nice growth chart.

1,091K questions answered by Q&A last month.

What kinds of features - most-used is auto-complete. 

"More tweets = more wins" for NBA finals. Not looking at population sentiment.

iOS app for PowerBI will be available this summer. Native applications. No comments about Android yet, but it seems likely.

Please speak about authentication for BI data on apps and cloud platforms. Active Directory, etc.

SSRS running in PowerBI. Going to be available by the end of the summer. Natively integrated. Taking care of all of the infrastructure. Connects to on-premise data source. OK, that's pretty awesome.

What about security?

### The Changing Face of BI

First - all in IT. 6-7 years ago it wasn't working.

6-7 years ago: self-service, focused on analysts and power users. PowerPivot, etc. Self-service BI.

Data Culture - give everybody the tools to satisfy their curiosity. This can be done in two ways: dumbing things down, elevating things up. 


### Ways of Interacting with Data

* Speed
* Accuracy
* Semantic meaning

The approach is still dashboards and professionals, not products.


"How to make data science so easy that anyone can do it?"

Forecasting in Power View in Office 365 - simple forecasting.

Going to be available in every line chart. 
Does seasonality and confidence interval.
Confidence interval's based on standard deviation. Assume normal distribution. 

ME - do this w/ Tableau forecasting, PowerBI for Notify data.

Data exploration mode- will be available, no date specified.

Time series analysis. Does time-series cross-validation to learn how. That's pretty awesome. 

ME - show housing prices. 

Now there are treemaps. 


Talk about information retrieval.
