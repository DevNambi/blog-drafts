# Finding A New Job

I've found that finding a new job involves several different 'phases':

* Identifying companies and job openings
* Applying to those jobs
* Interviewing and Company Culture
* Compensation
* Starting Off Strong

## Identifying Companies and Job Openings

Here's the wisdom I've found:

1. Good companies pay slightly less (but not a lot less) than bad companies
2. Working in a company with bad culture is toxic, and affects your entire life. Figure out which jobs and companies are toxic, and **run away**.
3. Recruiters and HR representatives act like gatekeepers. They're often not ineffective gatekeepers, because it's practically impossible to identify talented people from resumes and cover letters alone.
	* So, go around them. Build and use a network of professional contacts. Referrals and word-of-mouth are *still* the best way to find a new job that you'll like.
4. The real question in an interview is **"What can you do for me that the other candidates can't?"**

Question #4 is about **comparative advantage**. There are a few different ways to make yourself more appealing to employers:

* Technical skill. This is pretty rare. However, there are so many programming languages and tools that this can become a trap
* Domain skills. Pick an industry and stay there. This is how most people's careers work (teachers, lawyers, doctors, bankers, farmers, etc)
* Soft skill is the last. The ability to communicate, to connect with people, and to get stuff done in a varied workplace. However, this is hard to quantify or understand, so nobody values this correctly.


I've found various links with resources about job searching and resumes.

#### On Recruiters

* http://dandreamsofcoding.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/why-wont-anyone-talk-to-me-what-recruiters-look-for-in-a-resume/

@hmason: If everyone stopped paying recruiters the entire tech industry would probably gain years of productivity overnight.


## Interviewing

Interviews are one of the best times to find out about a company's culture, work-life balance, and the roles and responsibilities of a role. I go with a list of questions, because I want to find out about a company just as much as they want to find out about me.

#### My Interview Questions

**I Ask Managers**

* When building distributed software, how do you get other teams to build features/tools for you?
* When building distributed software, how do you balance building stuff for other teams vs. for your own?
* What percentage of time do you reserve for your developers to experiment/learn/innovate (without having to ask for anyone's approval/permission)?
* How do you battle/deal with [Conway's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law) ?
* When were the last 2-3 times you've changed your opinion about something technical because your developers convinced you?
* What do you want to learn next?
* How do you deal with different communications' preferences amongst your developers?
* What do you do when a PM asks for features at the last minute?
* How do you learn from your mistakes?
* Do you have a firewall that blocks sites/services for employees? Do you block StackOverflow?

**I Ask Potential Coworkers**

* How often do you work late, or on weekends? How many times in the last month?
* How often do you get paged late at night? How many times in the last month?
* How much time do you have to experiment/learn/innovate without getting anybody's approval?
* How do you test your code? What kinds of testing do you do?
* How do you learn from your mistakes?
* (For MSFT): How much does stack ranking and annual commitments determine what you do each month? How about this month?

@hintikka: KP (Kleiner Perkins) trial also confirms: if you have options and you clash w/ the structure of your workplace, leave. Structure will not change.
