## Technology Names and FUD

All technology products have names. While I try not to judge a book by its cover, I have found that some products can be identified as bad by their names alone.


### What's In a Name?

What does a project or product name tell us? At the most basic level, they exist for easy identification. MySQL and PostgreSQL aren't named 'RDBMS 1' and 'RDBMS 2' for this reason. 

At a second level, they exist for *branding*. This is where the wheels fall off, because brands have contradictory goals:

* They should be memorable
* They should be accessible
* They should describe the product

What I have found is that product/project names can tell you a lot about the culture of the organization creating them.

### First There was The Sale

When we are looking for a product to purchase, we need to know several things:

* What the product does
* How the product interrelates with *other* products
* Where it comes from
* Does it solve our business problem?
* Does the company creating it 
* The cost
* Supportability
* Unambiguous.

There is *no way* you can fit that into a single sentence, let alone a phrase or name.

I am sick and tired of products that are "branded" to appeal to sales people. Why? Projects named by marketing people are inevitably targeted towards business executives, CIOs, CTOs, and managers.

Here are some names of technology projects/services that are given sales-y names:

* Windows Azure
* Windows
* Office
* Access
* Word
* Excel
* Exchange
* PowerPoint
* Power View
* Power Query
* Power Pivot
* Power Shell
* Power BI
* In-Memory OLTP
* Q & A
* Windows Azure SQL Database
* SAP HANA
* SalesForce
* Sugar CRM
* Tableau



### Meanwhile, IRL

When we use a product day in and day out, we have different requirements:

* Easy to pronounce
* Unambiguous (both as a project and in normal language)

...and that's it.


### Age of the Geek

I am a huge fan of unusual project names, because unusual names tells me critical:

**The product is about substance, and not appearance**

I have seen far, far too many sales pitches for products that look great and never work correctly. I have a simple theory:

* There's never enough engineering talent to go around.
* One of the big limitations of any organization is the number of people who *detract* from the work that really matters
	* Managers (who aren't visionaries or practical)
	* PMs (who aren't customer advocates)
	* Salespeople / Marketing (who care more about sales than the product)
	* Legal (who are worried about potential liability)
	* Anybody who works primarily via email
	* Anybody who thinks in purely theoretical concerns.
* When engineers pick names, they have influence in the company
* When marketers pick names, they have influence in the company

Why? Because they are about function, and not appearance.

* What can it do?
* What are its capabilities?
* How does it work?
* What new features are involved?
* How do I adopt it?
* What are the limitations?
* How well does it compare to competing options?



Hadoop is not only the elephant in the room, *it's the name of a stuffed elephant*

(ADD PET IMAGE: I think that engineers either spend too much, or too little time with their pets)

I'm also a huge fan of technology project code names, because they're usually chosen by technical people. Marketing people don't pick names like this.

Why does this matter? 

I want to know about the signal:noise ratio in a product.

### Signal


### Noise

* Does it have all ___ list of features I don't care about?
* Is it 'enterprise' ready?


**Noisy Terms*

* AlwaysOn (replaces Hadron)
* PowerQuery
* PowerView
* In-Memory Index
* Columnstore Index (to replace Apollo)
* In-Memory OLTP (to replace Hekaton)
* Windows Azure SQL Database
* Windows Azure (to replace Red Dog)
* Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
* Simple Storage Service (S3)
* Word
* Excel
* Access
* Office
