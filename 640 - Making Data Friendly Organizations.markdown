* Well rounded data scienctists are pretty rare.
* Managers are thinking holistically (type 2)
* Scientists are thinking more tactically (type 1)

This was an exercise in feature eng and exploratory data analysis
* Barga wanted to learn something about the members of this class
* Expected to see natural clusters of profiles
* How would you measure similarity?
* "We want to understand who our customers are, how they use our product."
* You have to start w/ some features, initial criteria for calibrating

What would I do to improve the process for a subsequent round?
* A student learning this stuff has a different scale
* How do we define expert and could we infer from other data?
* How would it mean to standardize the scale?
* What features would you add?

*You will always screw up cohort clustering the first time*

### Next Few Years
* Data Science over the next few years will be darwinistic.
* Companies that can be data-driven will thrive.
* Others will die
* Data Science as a C-level position. Strategic decisions about data will be C-level decisions w/ a management chain

? Can you build data creativity as a muscle?
