# UW - Risk Aversion


### Risk Aversion

* 19-1 is a tie
* Don't do anything without checking to see if anybody's offended or objects
* Make decisions by consensus. 
* When in doubt, do what has been done before. That's the 'safe' thing to do.
* Make something comprehensive, that's complicated & can satisfy everybody. The opposite philosophy of MVP (LINKME)
* Never get rid of anything. 

The periodic nature of academia means it's easy to think of doing something in the *next* academic year. The anchoring time references are years, not quarters, months or weeks.
