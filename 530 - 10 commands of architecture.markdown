# 10 Commandments of System Architecture

- Blog post idea - 10 commandments of system architecture
   Each commandment comes from a truth of the world
   Truths of the world are a web
   No singletons
      Systems must scale
      Scale-out is cheaper & more efficient than scale-up
   Coupling is bad
      Development time is expense
      Time is money
      Time is short
   Interfaces are good things
      Design must be easily refactored
   80/20 rule
      Enlightened and lazy
      Time is money
      Systems have inertia
   Change is a constant
   • Blog post idea - how do we think about systems architecture?
   • Architect - needs to think at multiple level of abstractions. Jump between them
      § The easier the better

* Software engineering
* Trust, forgiveness, bad behavior & limits
* Boundaries and interfaces
* Abusive behavior
* Conway's Law
Therefore a failure top understand humans is a serious weakness
- Human factors in engineering
   • Nonlinear factors
   • Non-determinism
   • Error rates
   • Efficiency
