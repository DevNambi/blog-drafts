*This is becoming a blog post series*

http://vikparuchuri.com/blog/exploring-us-healthcare-data/

1. Why is this important. Financial risks. Ruin of your life. Principal-agent problem. 
2. Causes of bad health. Preventative vs. acute care
3. Preventative Care - Food
4. Preventative Care - Exercise
5. Preventative Care - Hobbies & Activities. Look for exemplars in other places
6. Preventative care - know a doc. Go back to barter.
7. Acute care - quality of hospitals vs. price

Distinction between preventative vs acute care

Where is health care expensive? Why?
Compare US Medicare prices to different country prices. Use recent articles for this.


Look at the prevalance of chronic, 'lifestyle' diseases. 
Come up with the time value of money based on salary. Then the time value of eating healthy.s
See if it's *ever* cost effective to rely on US-based medicine. Don't consider quality of life.

* Swimming
* Cycling
* Running
* Tennis
* Diving
* Football
* Baseball
* Weight lifting
* Walking
* Gyms
* Yoga?
* Zumba?

### Health from Work
* What's the benefit of a standing desk?
* What's the benefit to going to a less-stressful working environment?

### Health from Hobbies
* What are dangerous hobbies?
* What are


### Health from Medicine
* Drug side-effects
* Hospital infections
* Healthy and you're not worth anything. Sick and you're a gold mine. Perverse incentive to develop expensive treatments and not cheap cures.
* 

Look at Bayesian math and conditional probability for this.
