# Caching


• Caching and eviction policies
   § LRU (least recently used)
   § Time-based
   § LRU w/ priority (risk)
• Ways to store data in cache for fast retrieval
   § Similar to Thomas Kesjer's 'grade of the steel' blog posts
      § Use Powershell? C#? C++?
• O(1) and O(log N)

Go over core algorithms. Think about Peter Thiel's limitations of current software to rank them by importance.
