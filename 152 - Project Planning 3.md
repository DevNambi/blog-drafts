**Phases**

1. Assume customers of equal size, with equal request sizes. Assume all work is the same size. No contravening work. PMs of 1, 2, 3, up to 10 layers away. Add margins of error. 
	- To add a feature that isn't requested, how much clearer of vision do you need to have?
	- What are the implications?
	- What are the assumptions of guessing. How to reduce that risk. Sampling.
	- Since risk is roughly proportional to guesstimate size, assume random risk up to 2X the size of the estimate. See what happens.
	- Punish misses 5X more than early successes. Human psychology for underpromising and overdelivering.
2. Assume customers of unequal size, with unequal request sizes. Repeat
3. Assume work is unequal in size, with unequal risk and impact. Repeat.
 - Impact if we don't take on too small or too-large work. Why. Repeat.
4. Play with different assumptions. Cynical. Idealistic. See what happens.

 Size estimates are notoriously inaccurate, often wrong by an order of magnitude or more.

 Size estimates:

 * Takes 1 person 2 days = 2 days
 * Takes 5 people 2 weeks = 10 days
 * Takes 10 people 10 weeks = 100 days

Software estimates are usually logarithmic; making something bigger makes it 10X bigger, not 2X bigger. Also, the amount of risk increases proportionally. 

### Questions

* What happens when size estimates are unequal? How does risk play out?
* Think about how iteration reduces risk. Shifting baselines.
