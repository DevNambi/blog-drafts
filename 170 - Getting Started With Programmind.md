To get started, I'd recommend learning Python. It's one of the easiest languages to learn, and it's also one of the most widely used (http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2014/06/13/language-rankings-6-14/). It's also an open-source language, so you can install it anywhere. I'd recommend installing Anaconda (http://continuum.io/downloads), which takes care of a lot of the version-incompatibility headaches you can run into with open-source tools. 

There are some decent online sites that walk you through how to learn Python, notably Codeacademy (http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). I'd also recommend a couple of books, (http://learnpythonthehardway.org/, http://www.amazon.com/Python-Cookbook-Alex-Martelli/dp/0596007973). I'd start with the online sites to learn the basics, and then progress up to the books.

I'd also recommend signing up for a GitHub account (https://github.com/) and putting all of your code and projects there. GitHub accounts are free-and-open-source, and a lot of the most popular open-source tools are there (like Linux). If you work on projects regularly and improve, your GitHub account becomes a pretty compelling resume. 

It's going to take time, though, and a lot of patience. For me it was an endless series of evenings and weekends spent tinkering. One of my favorite teachers, Hilary Mason (http://www.hilarymason.com/), said that computer science is the endless process of playing with your curiosity and cleverness to find your way around an endless series of brick walls (http://www.hilarymason.com/presentations-2/devs-love-bacon-everything-you-need-to-know-about-machine-learning-in-30-minutes-or-less/ ). Many people run out of patience; it's probably the most common reason people stop learning to write code.

The best way I've heard of to fight the disillusionment problem is to use code to work on a problem you're interested in, so it's not as abstract. For Sean, that could be playing with the music/audio utilities in Python (https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonInMusic), or looking at stuff about Portland (food, housing, weather, etc). There are also local meetups that discuss programming (http://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/ and many others); those can be a lot of fun, and they're amazing places to learn.

I hope this helps.
Cheers!
