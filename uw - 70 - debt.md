# UW - Student Debt



Student debt is one of the big stories of our time. There are several broad discussions happening now:

* Publicize the sheer amount of student debt, at over 1 ***trillion*** dollars. 
* Recognize that the very idea of student debt is repugnant. It's morally dubious for a society to inflict debt and penury on its young. It is also very counterproductive, because debt-saddled students innovate less, take fewer risks, and do less work that benefits society as a whole: primary care medicine, scientific research, teaching, rural law, etc. 
* Add more money, usually in the form of additional state/federal funding. However, I don't know of any examples of when doing so made tuition or student debt *decrease*. (LINKS)
* Privatize higher education, letting 'the market' solve the problem. Unfortunately, this has been tried with for-profit colleges, with terrifyingly bad results. Students see an inferior academic experience, learn less, have fewer career opportunities and higher debt loads. (ADD LINKS).
* Trust to MOOCs and online learning, which scale far better than traditional, in-person education. Funny, though, the results aren't very impressive yet (LINK). I wonder what about the in-person, doesn't-scale part of education that is hard/impossible to duplicate on a computer. (ADD LINKS)

I have no particular preference or aversion to any of these ideas, but they darn well better **make the situation better**. 


Viz idea - revenue vs. professor income for each class.
