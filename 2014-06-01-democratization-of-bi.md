Fight the Hippo

Not everybody is cut out for this kind of work

Make better decisions

Same problem as voting. Most companies are autocratic, authoritarian, even fascist (dissent will not be tolerated). The main protection is people can vote with their feet. 


When is it a good idea

When is it a bad idea

Overfitting and cross-validation.

Problem: leadership doesn't know what to trust, because of FUD. Words, good stories and fancy arguments don't prove themselves without data.

Know how to spot logical fallacies and statistical fallacies. Cut through the noise.
