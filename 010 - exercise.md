* Variety is the spice of life
* It's about the money, stupid
* All the lonely people (groups vs. individual)
* Anything can be exercise. Remember the goal.
* Metrics matter.
* Know thyself (quantified self)
* Location, location, location. Options depend on where you live.
* Singing is good for your lungs.
* More than just getting blood flowing. Also about quality of life. Being able to move. Stretches.
