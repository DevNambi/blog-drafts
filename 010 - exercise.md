One of the [best ways to stay healthy is to be active](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUaInS6HIGo). It's never obvious what I should do *right now* to be active. 

Staying active is difficult, though, because there are so many options that it becomes hard to choose.

Exercise is a data problem.

### Know Thyself

* Social psychology (people do better when accountable to groups)
* People quit when it feels like a chore or burden.
* Variety helps break monotony.


### It's About Psychology, Stupid

People start a new sport, or activity, and [then stop](http://diabeteshealth.com/read/2006/11/01/2150/why-people-quit-exercising/). **Why**?

There are [several reasons](http://www.scai.org/SecondsCount/Resources/Detail.aspx?cid=b8df77f6-a26c-4fd4-a3ec-3bf5874d24f3):

* It takes a lot of time
* It doesn't feel like fun
* It's expensive
* The weather is bad
* It feels embarrassing.

### Location, Location, Location


### All the Lonely People




* Variety is the spice of life
* It's about the money, stupid
* All the lonely people (groups vs. individual)
* Anything can be exercise. Remember the goal.
* Metrics matter.
* Know thyself (quantified self)
* Location, location, location. Options depend on where you live.
* Singing is good for your lungs.
* More than just getting blood flowing. Also about quality of life. Being able to move. Stretches.



The 80/20 rule applies here as well. What are the most effective ways you can become and stay healthy? Moderate exercise and eating healthy. Walking 10K steps a day and eating more green vegetables is almost always a good start.

When we look at time, we should also look at quality of time. How much time are you willing to spend walking during the day, and cooking healthy food, in return for years of better health when you're older?

I don't know the best diet or exercise plan; I'm not a doc. 

* Here, the goal is simple: I want to be healthy all the time. When I get sick or hurt, I want to recover as quickly and fully as possible. 
* Intrinsically healthy people are bad for health care as a business. They don't buy anything.
   * The principal-agent problem comes into play. People have their own incentives.
* Add in the concept of spent vs. gained time


* Domain knowledge of health care
* Questioning your options - reframing the problem
* Medical data: what happens when the most valuable data isn't public
	* Cost of procedures
	* What procedures are common for a given operation
	* Insurance rates
	* Cost of equipment
* Everything is a data problem
	* Health, exercise, food, you name it
* DEMO - Exercise as a data problem

### Feature Extraction

* Outdoor or not
	* Weather Requirements
* Cost
* Benefit of skill
* Popularity in each city
* Easy to integrate into daily routine
* Typical time requirements
* Popularity


### Insights

* The most popular sports are group sports that can also be spectator sports. That's where the money is
* Every individual sport can also be done in groups
