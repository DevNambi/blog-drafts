Being healthy is a data problem. There are too many options to choose from when looking at nutrition, exercise and medicine. Most people in the US and Europe people [suffer, pay, and die](http://healthcarecostmonitor.thehastingscenter.org/kimberlyswartz/projected-costs-of-chronic-diseases/) from chronic '[lifestyle diseases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_disease).'

One of the best ways to stay healthy is [to be moderately active](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUaInS6HIGo).

**Why do people suffer from preventable diseases when there are many ways to avoid them?**

I suspect having so many choices is itself a challenge. It's easy to pick between 3-5 options; it's impossibly hard to pick from thousands of them.

Data can help narrow down choices *per person* so it's easier to decide what to do right now to be active. 


### Stalling

Here's a typical scenario: someone starts a new sport/activity and [then stop](http://diabeteshealth.com/read/2006/11/01/2150/why-people-quit-exercising/). **Why**?

It turns out researchers already asked that question, and found [several reasons](http://www.scai.org/SecondsCount/Resources/Detail.aspx?cid=b8df77f6-a26c-4fd4-a3ec-3bf5874d24f3):

* It doesn't feel like fun
* It feels embarrassing.
* It takes a lot of time
* It's expensive
* The weather is bad

What's interesting is that 3 of these reasons are external (time, price, weather), while the other two are mental barriers.

Finding good, healthy activities [isn't a marathon, it's a maze](http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2014/04/03/lost-in-a-labyrinth-getting-healthy-isnt-a-straight-shot/).

Let's look at the mental challenges first.

### Know Thyself

When faced with a mental barrier, a great way to success is to understand and manipulate you own personality quirks to achieve an outcome. However, people are very different, so much of the advice out there won't work for everyone.

For example:

* Do you push yourself more when your results are visible to your family & friends? Or does that make you feel isolated?
* Do you enjoy trying new activites? Or do you enjoy having a few familiar exercises? 
* Does a competitive sport make you try harder, or give up faster?

I started with a list of 68 sports. Of those, 38 can be done alone. The other 30 must be done in groups.

#### Not Fun


ME - look through sports list, identify stuff that's relevant for me. Walk people through that process. 

#### Embarrassment

Human beings are often proud. We don't like to appear weak, helpless, or *less*. This is especially true when starting something new.

### Price

* It's about the money, stupid


### Time

* Something spent, something gained
* Location, location, location. Options depend on where you live.

### Weather

* Location, location, location. Options depend on where you live.

### Watch Out For Snakes

* Principal-agent problem.


### All the Lonely People


* Variety is the spice of life
* All the lonely people (groups vs. individual)
* Anything can be exercise. Remember the goal.
* Metrics matter.
* Know thyself (quantified self)
* Singing is good for your lungs.
* More than just getting blood flowing. Also about quality of life. Being able to move. Stretches.



* Questioning your options - reframing the problem

### Feature Extraction

* Outdoor or not
	* Weather Requirements
* Cost
* Benefit of skill
* Popularity in each city
* Easy to integrate into daily routine
* Typical time requirements
* Popularity


### Insights

* The most popular sports are group sports that can also be spectator sports. That's where the money is
* Every individual sport can also be done in groups 


# Presentation Talking points

* 80/20 rule
* Quality of life
* Quality of time
* Time spent, time gained
* Disclaimer at the end


* Here, the goal is simple: I want to be healthy all the time. When I get sick or hurt, I want to recover as quickly and fully as possible. 
* Intrinsically healthy people are bad for health care as a business. They don't buy anything.
   * The principal-agent problem comes into play. People have their own incentives.
* Add in the concept of spent vs. gained time
