* Sleep
* Meditation
* Eating well
	* Veggies
	* Not too much
* Different ways when fighting a problem
	* Graph paper. Think in networks and diagrams.
	* Thinking in the shower
	* Always write down notes
	* Go for a walk
	* Talk out loud. To a duck. To Yorick.
* Pomodoro
* Good ideas happen almost randomly
* Walk
* Drink lots of water
* Don't work too much. Diminishing returns.
* Brains are biology
* Human beings are state machines. 
* Multiple things going on.
* Don't go full-tilt all the time. Find a sustainable balance.
* Play music
	* The smartest engineers I know are also musicians.
	* That makes sense. Music does odd things to connections in the brain.





I always spend the week before the New Year reflecting on the last year. For 2013, I wanted to see what influences productivity. In particular, what do highly productive *and happy* people do that they have in common?


### Dev Dreams of Code

First of all, productive people sleep. As much as I want to imagine I am some god-like ubermensch floating above a sea of mortals, my body and brain are complex chemical creations that are *entirely reliant* upon natural processes.

If I sleep less than 7 hours a day, I'm largely useless that day. I can get menial stuff done, but I don't have the flashes of inspiration I normally do. It's also much harder for me to fall into that zen-like coding-meditation state where I feel like I'm dreaming more than writing code.

There's a lot of information, both scientific and anecdotal, backing this up. It's what [Hacker News visitors](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6851384) mention the most. [It flushes horrific chemicals/proteins out of your brain](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/brains-flush-toxic-waste-in-sleep-including-alzheimers-linked-protein-study-of-mice-finds/2013/10/19/9af49e40-377a-11e3-8a0e-4e2cf80831fc_story.html). [It's Easier to Eat Better](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/how-sleep-deprivation-makes-us-want-to-eat-fat/278447/). [You'll Look Better](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/sleep-deprivation-makes-us-appear-unattractive-and-sad/279239/). Oh, and [you'll decay less](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/how-sleep-deprivation-decays-the-mind-and-body/282395/). 

For those of you 'brogrammers' out there, [it's not 'manly' to be sleep deprived](http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/11/real-men-go-to-sleep/). In fact, it [depletes glucose levels in your brain](http://explore.noodle.org/post/60790701127/sleep-deprivation-depletes-the-glucose-level-in). 


* http://io9.com/the-real-reason-why-sleep-deprivation-can-destroy-you-1447241194
* [Get an extra hour's sleep](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24444634)

### Life Tuning

Every developer and IT person I've ever met has had to tweak their code to get better performance. Oddly, very few of them seem to do the same thing with their jobs or lives. Let's look over the basic rules of code optimization.

1. [Stop doing things](http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2013/11/what-are-you-going-to-stop-doing-in-2014.html). 
2. [Stop accepting new load. Say No.](http://www.inc.com/curt-hanke/the-discipline-of-saying-no.html). At the very least [ask Questions Before Saying Yes](http://www.theklarichter.com/11-questions-to-ask-yourself-before-you-say-yes/)
3. [Don't overload your system](http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/why-working-more-than-40-hours-a-week-is-useless.html)
4. [Don't wait. Do things immediately](http://www.machinedlearnings.com/2013/06/productivity-is-about-not-waiting.html). [Heck, get unpleasant tasks over with first](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/just-get-it-over-with/282013/).
5. Don't try and multitask. I've had *suspiciously* good luck [using a Pomodoro timer and working on only 1 task at a time](http://www.not-implemented.com/be-more-productive-avoid-task-switching/).
6. Take breaks. [Exercise](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=89960). I take a 10-minute walk every hour. My best ideas occur when I'm walking around.
